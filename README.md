# Product Table
## Date:
## Objective:

To create a structured HTML table that displays product-related information, including product names, prices, and descriptions, useful for catalogs, listings, or e-commerce prototypes.

## Tasks:

### 1. Set Up the Basic HTML Structure:

Use ```<!DOCTYPE html>```, ```<html>```, ```<head>```, and ```<body>``` tags to define the document layout.

Include a ```<title>``` such as "Product Table".

### 2. Create a Table Element:

Use the ```<table>``` tag to begin the product table.

### 3. Add a Table Header:

Use the ```<thead>``` section with a ```<tr>``` row and three ```<th>``` elements:

Product Name

Product Price

Description

### 4. Insert Table Body Rows:

Use the ```<tbody>``` section with multiple ```<tr>``` rows.

In each row, use three ```<td>``` cells for:

The name of the product (e.g., Laptop, Phone)

The price (e.g., â‚¹45,000, $499)

A short description (e.g., "High-speed performance", "Budget-friendly")

### 5. Ensure Semantic Structure:

Include ```<caption>``` if needed to describe the table purpose.

Use meaningful text inside the table for clarity.

### 6. No CSS or JavaScript:

Keep the table design strictly in HTML for simplicity.
